Python Community Secret Santa

Rough Draft Thoughts:

1. Social signup - openid, facebook, twitter
2. Links in profiles to projects/sites/github/bitbucket repos 
    2a. proof of involvement - "social proof"
3. 50$ USD or *under*
4. Donations to non profit organizations can be requested in lieu of gift
5. Links to wishlists in profiles (newegg, thinkgeek, amazon, etc)
6. Profiles should have "interests" and "dislikes" 
7. Important to note to factor in intl. shipping. Also, often, it's possible to order from a local store (like amazon.co.uk or a local shop) without incurring crazy shipping.
    7a. Might also want to match gifters/giftees by location (at least within the same country) to avoid int'l shipping.
8.
